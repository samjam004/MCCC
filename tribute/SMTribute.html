            to join SKT T1 K and start as their midlaner. His debut let him showcase his absolute dominance on Nidalee, landing spears
            with precision against some of the greatest players of the time. In 2015 he won his first championship. He went on to win 2 more
            along with multiple LCK finals, including one in 2021, and is still playing as part owner of T1 eSports.
